Changes in Silvet v1.1 since the previous release v1.0:

 * The "draft" mode has been replaced by "live" mode. This usually
   produces worse results than "draft" did, but it is much faster and
   has much lower processing latency. (The "draft" mode occupied an
   uncomfortable role -- not fast enough to be usable in real-time or
   low-power situations, not good enough to be a useful alternative to
   the default processing mode.)

 * The plugin has new outputs for note onsets only; onsets and
   offsets; pitch activation matrix; and pitch chroma distribution
   (chromagram).

 * Some thresholds have been adjusted to improve performance in test
   datasets.

 * The expectation-maximisation process is now initialised
   deterministically rather than from random data, so the plugin
   now produces the same results on every run.
