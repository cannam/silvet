/*

   The shiftedW.txt file contains the data from shiftedW.mat in the
   amt_mssiplca_fast repository, exported as text via MATLAB dlmwrite.

   This is described as "3 sets of piano templates learned from MAPS
   database".

   The data consists of a 4D array of dimensions 5 x 88 x 545 x 3.

   I believe these dimensions are:
    * bins per semitone (5)
    * semitones, or number of components (88)
    * spectral profile for a single pitch template (545)
    * distinct piano sources (3)

   In the text file, it is formatted as 5 rows of 143880 values.  Each
   row contains 88 consecutive values from shiftedW(row,1,1,1) to
   shiftedW(row,88,1,1), then 88 values from shiftedW(row,1,2,1) to
   shiftedW(row,88,2,1), etc.

   Here we load the file, convert it to a more structured JSON format,
   and write it out again as templates.json.
