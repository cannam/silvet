batchProcessingEvaluate.m evaluates a set of .lab output files against
MIDI "ground truth".

The MIDI files can be found in ../TRIOS-groundtruth, and some examples
of the .lab files in ../TRIOS-mirex2012-matlab and ../TRIOS-silvet.

evaluate_lab.yeti evaluates one lab file against another, onsets only,
to a given timing tolerance.
