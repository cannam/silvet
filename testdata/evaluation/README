 * run.sh is our basic Silvet evaluation script. It runs Silvet
against single- and multiple-instrument files from the TRIOS dataset
using the theoretically best settings for each file, and then
evaluates the results against the ground truth and MIREX 2012
submission.

 * batchProcessingEvaluate.m evaluates a set of .lab output files
against MIDI.  The MIDI can be found in ../TRIOS-groundtruth, and some
example .lab files in ../TRIOS-mirex2012-matlab and ../TRIOS-silvet.

 * evaluate_lab.yeti evaluates one lab file against another, onsets
only, to a given timing tolerance.
