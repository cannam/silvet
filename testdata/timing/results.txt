DEBUG/RELEASE:

commit:ce64d11ef336, release build of Silvet, release build of qm-dsp

real	1m44.456s

commit:ce64d11ef336, debug build of Silvet, release build of qm-dsp

real	14m16.124s
user	14m16.907s
sys	0m0.217s

commit:ce64d11ef336, release build of Silvet, debug build of qm-dsp

real	1m55.204s
user	1m55.053s
sys	0m0.253s

Subsequent tests use release builds of both.


VAMP FEATURE SUPPRESSION:

commit:7133f78ccbf6, as commit:ce64d11ef336 but with CQ output feature
return commented out

real	1m46.162s
user	1m46.093s
sys	0m0.157s

commit:78a7bf247016, as commit:ce64d11ef336 but with CQ output and FCQ
output feature return commented out

real	1m45.206s
user	1m45.153s
sys	0m0.147s

conclusion: no advantage in removing these


DEBUG PRINTOUTS:

commit:f3bf6503e6c6, as commit:ce64d11ef336 but with debug printouts
removed

real	1m43.744s
user	1m43.657s
sys	0m0.203s

conclusion: obviously we want to remove these eventually, but might as
well keep in during testing


EM ITERATIONS:

commit:5314d3361dfb, as commit:ce64d11ef336 but with only 6 EM
iterations instead of 12

real	0m59.055s
user	0m58.897s
sys	0m0.193s

conclusion: EM dominates the time taken, not CQ or note forming


CQ DECIMATOR CONFIGURATION:

Uncommitted revision (because changes are in CQ subrepo) that is as
commit:ce64d11ef336 but with resampler SNR=30 and BW=0.04 instead of
SNR=60 and BW=0.02

real	1m43.176s
user	1m43.067s
sys	0m0.190s

conclusion: supports the previous test


EM TWEAKS:

commit:a0dedcbfa628, as commit:ce64d11ef336 but with variables hoisted
out of loops and consts added wherever applicable

real	1m44.548s
user	1m44.460s
sys	0m0.183s

conclusion: compiler already knows this stuff

commit:64b08cc12da0, as commit:ce64d11ef336 but with loops merged so
as theoretically to reduce intermediate calculations

real	3m46.969s
user	3m46.850s
sys	0m0.220s
